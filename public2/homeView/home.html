            <strong>
                Check your filter every month, especially during heavy use months (winter and summer).
            </strong>
             If the filter looks dirty after a month,
            change it. At a minimum, change the filter every 3 months. A dirty filter will slow down air flow and make the system work harder to keep you warm or cool — wasting energy. A clean filter will also prevent dust and dirt from building
            up in the system — leading to expensive maintenance and/or early system failure.
